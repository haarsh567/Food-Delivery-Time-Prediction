# Food Delivery Time Prediction

## Overview

This machine learning project is designed to predict food delivery times based on various features. The project utilizes Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, analysis, and model training. Key libraries such as pandas, plotly, numpy, and Keras (with Dense and LSTM layers) are employed to facilitate different aspects of the machine learning pipeline.

## Features

- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation:** Python code and machine learning models are implemented and tested in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and preprocessing are performed using the pandas library.
- **Plotly:** Interactive visualizations are created using Plotly for better understanding and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical operations are conducted using the NumPy library.
- **Keras with Dense and LSTM Layers:** Neural network models are built using the Keras library, incorporating Dense layers for traditional feedforward networks and LSTM layers for sequence prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques such as normalization, encoding, and handling missing values are applied for effective model training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## Project Structure
